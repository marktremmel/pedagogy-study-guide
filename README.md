## 🎓 Learning Methodology

This tool is built on evidence-based learning science:

### **Active Recall**
Testing yourself is 2x more effective than re-reading. The flashcard and quiz modes force you to retrieve information from memory, strengthening neural pathways.

### **Spaced Repetition**
Mark difficult cards for review and revisit them across multiple study sessions. The tool tracks your mastery to help you focus on weak areas.

### **Multi-Modal Learning**
Combines visual (concept map), interactive (flashcards), and written (quiz) modalities to engage different learning styles.

### **Self-Assessment**
The quiz's self-scoring mechanism helps you develop metacognitive awareness of what you truly understand vs. what you only recognize.

## 📅 Recommended Study Plan
